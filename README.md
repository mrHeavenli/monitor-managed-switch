## THIS PROJECT IS NOW ARCHIVED
I won't be working on this anymore, but its code lives on
in [addr.changer](https://github.com/mrHeavenli/addr.changer), which has more features.

# monitor-managed-switch
Switches network adapter mode

## Usage

```
./main.sh ADAPTER MODE
Must be run with sudo

Modes:
1: Managed
2: Monitor
```

## Does it work?
You can check if the switch worked by using [wavemon](https://github.com/uoaerg/wavemon).
Please note that switching takes a few moments to register.
